to run python in the terminal:
set_pg then filename.py

make sure to dowload the correct versions of postgresql

for some reason, capital letter tables dont work and the chinook database has been updated and the format of the table names are different. remember this.
eg, before "AlbumId", Now "album_id" etc

to access database, /l and /dt and / q to exit
